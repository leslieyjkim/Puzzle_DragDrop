Steps to Cut an Image into 18 Square Pieces
Determine the Size of Each Piece:

Decide the dimensions of your final puzzle. If you want a square puzzle, you need to split the image into a grid that can be evenly divided into 18 squares.
For simplicity, you might opt for a grid of 3 rows and 6 columns, or 6 rows and 3 columns.
Resize the Image (if necessary):

Ensure the image dimensions are divisible by the number of rows and columns you choose. For example, if you choose 3 rows and 6 columns, the image should be divisible by 3 and 6 (e.g., 300x600 pixels or 600x600 pixels).
